----------------------------


###Description


Data Analyzer is a program which allows for conducting a basic linguistic analysis of any English text. It makes use of The Natural Language Toolkit ([NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)) -  a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. The program focuses on **content words** - words that contribute to the meaning of the sentence in which they occur(nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs).
