# Data Analyzer
----------------------------


### Description


Data Analyzer is a program which allows for conducting a basic linguistic analysis of any English text. It makes use of The Natural Language Toolkit ([NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)) -  a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. The program focuses on **content words** - words that contribute to the meaning of the sentence in which they occur (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs). Separate analyses of the four parts of speech might prove useful for individuals working in the field of linguistics (e.g. comparative linguistics or stylistics), as well as for students, educators, researchers, and writers.

### Functionalities
The program is divided into 2 parts:

 - **General Section** - displays an opened text document on the left and its general analysis (which includes the number of types, tokens and the [type-token ratio](https://carla.umn.edu/learnerlanguage/spn/comp/activity4.html#:~:text=A%20type-token%20ratio%20%28TTR,a%20given%20segment%20of%20language.)) on the right.
 - **Analysis** - allows for separate analyses for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. It contains such information as the total number of words categorized to one of the four categories in relation to the total number of words in the analyzed text, a list of 20 most frequent words assigned to a given category, and the number of their occurences in the text. Additionally, it allows for saving a complete list of most frequent words from a given category as a .txt file.

### Usage

As mentioned above, the program might prove useful for linguists, students, educators, researchers, and writers. Some applications of Data Analyzer might include:

 - analyzing the **complexity of texts** (by means of the type-token ratio) and making general predictions about the author's characteristics (his/her age, social status, etc.)
 - analyzing **shifts in preferences** regarding the use of particular words over a longer period of time (comparative and historical linguistics)
 - analyzing one's **style of writing** in terms of vocabulary choices (especially useful for linguists working in the field of stylistics)
 - analyzing the **tone of messages** (looking at the adjectives/adverbs used in the text)
 -  analyzing the most freequent words in order to get **a general idea about the topic** of the text (for  publishers, and content developers such a tool might give insight into the main message the author wants to convey and quickly allow to tag a particular piece of text)
 - looking for **repetitive words** in order to improve one's style of writing (especially useful for students, researchers, and writers who want to improve the readability of their texts)
 - learning **the basics of syntax** (e.g. by analyzing the structure of annotated texts or investigating words assigned to particular parts of speech)
 
### Requirements
For the program to run properly, you must install The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). You can [download](https://www.nltk.org/install.html) the package from the official website before running the program. In case you do not do it, Data Analyzer will redirect you to the website when you run the program. 

NLTK requires Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8.
